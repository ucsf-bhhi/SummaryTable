# Introduction to SummaryTable

This package was created to generate summary statics tables for one to two-cross tabs on the fly. You need to provide a data set with the variables you want to summarise.

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r setup}
library(SummaryTable)
```


## Example

### Data: iris

This is the output for `Sepal.Width` a continuous variable w/o stratification. Without any other sepcification, the function spits out the mean and SD.

```{r}
var_summarise(dat = iris, var = "Sepal.Width")
```

This is an example as above but stratified by `species` using the `treatment` argument.

```{r}
var_summarise(dat = iris, var = "Sepal.Width", treatment = "Species")
```

Likewise, you can use this function for different variable types. For instance, get the count (%) of `treatment`.

```{r}
var_summarise(dat = iris, var = "Species")
```

If you _only_ provide the dataset, then the function will try to detect and summarise the data based on `typeof`. But you will get a message that all variables were used.

```{r}
var_summarise(dat = iris)
```
