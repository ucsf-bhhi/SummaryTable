This repo contains the source function to generate one or two-way cross tab summary stats on the fly with `var_summarise()`

# Installation

Make sure you have `devtools` already installed and loaded.

`install.packages("devtools")`

```{r}
library(devtools)

install_github("ucsf-bhhi/SummaryTable ")
```

# Examples


This package was created to generate summary statics tables for one to two-cross tabs on the fly. You need to provide a data set with the variables you want to summarise.

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r setup}
library(SummaryTable)
```


## Example

### Data: iris

This is the output for `Sepal.Width` a continuous variable w/o stratification. Without any other sepcification, the function spits out the mean and SD.

```{r}
var_summarise(dat = iris, var = "Sepal.Width")
```
